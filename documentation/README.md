# TurntableStrobe User Manual
Use TurntableStrobe, a highly accurate, tiny, hand held LED strobe, to check the pitch calibration of your turntable.

## Why Calibrate?
To ensure your records play back at the correct pitch (speed), you need to calibrate your deck using a turntable strobe. For the highest accuracy, TurntableStrobe uses a quartz crystal rated ±0.003% accuracy at 25°C, more than accurate enough to ensure a precise calibration.

Though many turntables have built-in strobes, they run off of the mains frequency which [varies over time](http://dabbledoo.weebly.com/mains-frequency.html). And, many turntables have no strobe. In either case, TurntableStrobe provides a quick and easy, but highly accurate, calibration reference at low cost.

## Getting Started
* Remove TurntableStrobe and the CR1225 battery from the anti-static bag
* Remove the CR1225 battery from its bubble
* Match the ```+``` symbol on the battery and battery holder
* Insert the battery with the ```+``` symbols facing up.
* Just press the button on top to activate the strobe.

## How to Calibrate Your Turntable
If you have timing marks, see *Timing Marks* below. If not, skip that section.

### Timing Marks

1. If your turntable does _not_ have timing marks on the platter, print out one of these free turntable strobe discs on your printer:
  * [60Hz.pdf](http://www.extremephono.com/ftp/60Hz.PDF) for 60Hz TurntableStrobe
  * [50Hz.pdf](http://www.extremephono.com/ftp/50Hz.PDF) for 50Hz TurntableStrobe
* Cut out the disc and cut out a hole for the turntable spindle.
* Remove any records from the turntable
* Place the strobe disc on the turntable

### Checking Calibration
1. Start the turntable (refer to your owner's manual if necessary)
* Select the timing marks corresponding to the current turntable speed
* Hold the TurntableStrobe approximately 2" (5cm) away from the timing marks (on the platter or strobe disc, as applicable)
* Press the TurntableStrobe button to activate the light
* The timing marks should now appear distinct though possibly a little bit blurry
* If the marks appear to be moving slowly, calibration is off

If your turntable has an external pitch or speed adjustment knob, you can now adjust the speed of your deck.

### Adjusting Pitch
Some turntables have separate pitch knobs for 45 rpm and 33-1/3 rpm. Some only have a single pitch knob.

1. Find the pitch knob corresponding to the current speed of the turntable.
* Adjust the pitch knob very slowly until the timing marks appear to be stationary
* You may find the marks will move slowly forward and backward
  * This variation in pitch is normal and is called *wow*.
  * Typically, better turntables have lower variation in pitch.
* To calibrate for an average speed, ensure the timing marks appear to move forward and backward by the same amount; that is, they remain stationary *on average*.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Causes | Solution |
|----|----|----|
| Timing marks are an indistinct blur | Mismatch between timing marks and strobe | Select 50Hz marks for 50Hz strobe and 60Hz marks for 60Hz strobe |
||45RPM speed selected but 33-1/3 timing marks are illuminated, or vice versa. | Illuminate the marks corresponding to speed selection  |
| Timing difficult to make perfectly stationary | Speed/Pitch potentiometer is dirty | Clean potentiometer with Deoxit and lubricate with FaderLube or equivalent |
||Turntable wow| Lower end turntables may have a fair bit of wow. As long as you can't hear pitch variation when playing back long, sustained notes, you can ignore the wow and do your best to adjust pitch. If wow sounds excessive, you can try cleaning and lubricating the pitch potenitometer as above, replacing the belt if applicable, and/or having the turntable checked and serviced. |
| Very dim light or strobe does not light up at all | Battery is low | Change battery |

## Accuracy
The quartz crystals selected for use on the Turntable strobe modules have a frequency tolerance of ±30 ppm at 25 ºC (±0.003%). Temperature stability is ±30 ppm over (-20ºC - +70ºC) but of course we can expect a much narrower tolerance for normal indoor temperatures.

I measure the frequency of every single TurntableStrobe before selling it. So far. frequencies range between -0.0015% to -0.0035% of the target frequency. Testing is conducted in my basement at around 20-25°C using a Saleae Logic analyzer with 42ns accuracy.
