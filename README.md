# TurntableStrobe

Check your turntable's speed with TurntableStrobe, a highly accurate, tiny, low-cost, handheld turntable strobe. Or retrofit your turntable with the permanent-mount version.

With a crystal rated ±0.003% accuracy at 25°C, it is far more accurate than a mains frequency strobe on most turntables.
